2.1 "Flaky BOM service"

A BOM service is typically used in production scenarios, e.g. in
construction of automobiles. The BOM represents the total cost of all parts of the
assembled product.

The task is to query it in your code without your code ever crashing while producing the
correct result. In a first preparation step, use the serviceâ€™s interface to request the data
without any parameters.

You will see that sometimes, the request will fail, and you will need to handle that in a smart way.

The service has a simple HTTP GET interface: http://160.85.252.148
